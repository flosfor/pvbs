1) Run PVBS (pvbs.m)
(designed for Prairie View 5.5; developed with Matlab 2020b, requires statistics & machine learning toolbox)

2) Unzip sampledata.zip

3) Load sampledata.mat from PVBS using "Load Dataset (.mat)" 
(NOT "Load PV Experiment (.xml, .csv)" - this function is for loading experiments saved from Prairie View (VoltageRecording, LineScan, TSeries; via respective metadata), or .csv exported from PVBS)
